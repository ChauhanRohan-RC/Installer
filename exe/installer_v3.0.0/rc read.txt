setup.exe requires an info file and data zip and install ico

1. info file:
   -> name = 'info.cc'
   -> contains a dictionary dumped by pickle in form :  {'zip_name' : 'main.zip',
                                                'exe_in_zip': ['reg.exe', 'as.exe', ],  to be executed after extraction, paths relative to zip
                                                'soft_name': 'Twilight',
                                                'version': '7.9.8',
                                                'soft_author': 'Rc',
                                                'soft_des': 'description'
                                                'uninstall_key_name': 'Twilight',  in windows registry, to cross check installation
                                                'main_exe_name': 'Twilight'}   	   main exe name to cross check installation
                                                'permissions' : 'no'}   'no' or 'yes' (to allow read and write permissions in install dir)


2. zip file to be extracted
   -> name = as defined in info.cc
   -> zip should not contain root directory, it will be created automatically

3. If previous installation is found (by checking uninstall registry info and main_exe given in info.cc),
   uinstall option will execute uninstaller with '-force' arg (to avoid any ui)

4. sdk dir should be in same dir as installer.exe, with software source files (main.zip and info.cc) in src dir
